  "The New York Times (The Athletic content)": "Mohamed Salah’s new deal is signed – now to get him scoring again - The Athletic EPL Teams Scores & Schedule Standings Fantasy The Athletic FC Newsletter Podcasts Salah Signs New Two-Year Liverpool Contract Mohamed Salah’s new deal is signed – now to get him scoring again By Gregg Evans April 11, 2025 Updated 4:21 am EDT This piece has been updated after Mohamed Salah signed a new two-year contract at Liverpool . Mohamed Salah has had a remarkable season. He is on course to win the Premier League’s. Golden Boot (he has 27 goals, six clear of the injured Erling Haaland and seven in front of Alexander Isak) and is just three off Andy Cole and Alan Shearer’s joint league record of 47 goal involvements in a season with seven games remaining. Advertisement His form and physical condition have been enough to convince Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owners, to rip up their usual policy around older players and offer him a new two-year contract , which has now been signed. His form was such that, back in February, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot was discussing Salah’s chances of winning the Ballon d’Or . He made the point that those hopes hinged on Liverpool’s trophy haul , at a time when Liverpool were already in control of the title race, had a Carabao Cup final looming and were still in the Champions League. Six weeks later, the landscape has changed. Liverpool remain on course for an emphatic Premier League title victory, a superb achievement given this is Slot’s first season in English football, but results have dipped. Paris Saint-Germain ended Liverpool’s interest in the Champions League, Newcastle United were worthy winners in the Carabao Cup final and while victories are still generally being prised out in league games, performances have dipped, certainly in comparison to the team’s brilliant form up until February. Salah’s own fortunes have followed a similar trend. The 32-year-old has not scored from open play in seven games, with the last of his goals both coming from the penalty spot in the 3-1 win over Southampton on March 8. Since then, he hasn’t scored or assisted and is now on the longest run (four games) without a goal involvement for Liverpool since March 2021. The timing may be significant. His only previous experience of going five games without a goal or assist for the club also came in March, in 2019. Springtime, for whatever reason, does not always suit Salah. Salah’s penalty against Southampton was his last goal for Liverpool (Carl Recine/Getty Images) So, for all the golden glow sparked by news of his contract extension, and Liverpool’s impending title celebrations, it is still reasonable to explore why the assists and goals have dried up for Salah and how he, and Liverpool, can get back to the dizzying heights of earlier this campaign. There are some specific circumstances around Salah which may have affected his recent form. One is Ramadan, the Islamic holy month which requires Muslims to fast from dawn to dusk every day. A 2007 study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine , which analysed 55 male players during Ramadan, found that their performances declined significantly in categories such as speed, agility, dribbling and endurance, with nearly 70 per cent of those studied believing that their ability to train and play effectively had been adversely impacted. Advertisement Salah is in remarkable physical shape, and has started every one of Liverpool’s 31 Premier League games this season. But it would hardly be surprising if the additional strain on his body had not impacted on his performances, even if the variation in the timing of Ramadan year on year means it may not be a reason behind his other spring slumps. There are football reasons, too. Since the latter stages of the second-leg defeat to PSG, Salah has also been playing without a recognised right-back behind him following Trent Alexander-Arnold’s injury in the tie and Conor Bradley’s continued layoff. Alexander-Arnold’s absence has certainly limited Liverpool’s attacking threat and it has impacted Salah’s ability to find space in dangerous areas down the right. There is a drop-off in how much he’s creating and how successful he has been in one-on-one battles with opponents more recently. Salah’s combined non-penalty xG and xA in the last eight games amounts to 0.41 per 90; before that it was 0.89. The graph below shows that he is holding his width more often now, despite a lot of his success previously coming from cutting inside towards goal. That his goals have stopped flowing at the prolific rate of earlier months is no great shock. Racing to 32 strikes from the first 41 appearances in all competitions was a level bordering on ridiculous. It’s why all those discussions about the Ballon d’Or were justified. So what’s changed? Well, it’s not as if he’s now missing multiple chances — he’s just not getting them as often. Then, when he does get into those dangerous positions, he just hasn’t been as clinical as in previous months. Against Fulham, Salah blazed over from close range when he should have done better, and a few days earlier in the Merseyside derby win over Everton, he headed straight at Jordan Pickford from inside the box. Liverpool also haven’t won a penalty in four games, which has halted him in his tracks of recording the most prolific Premier League season ever for goal involvements (Salah has scored all nine of the penalties Liverpool have won, the most in the Premier League). Advertisement Salah’s telepathic connection with Cody Gakpo, and to a slightly less extent, Luis Diaz, has also been disrupted — by a loss of fitness in Gakpo’s case, and form in Diaz’s. Earlier in the season, Salah’s crossing to the back post had become a rich source for goals. Liverpool had memorable moments against Everton, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City, Fulham (home), Bayern Leverkusen, Chelsea, Bologna, and Manchester United from such positions, as you can see from some of",

The forward said he had chosen to stay because he believes “we can win a lot of big trophies together”. With his contract due to expire at the end of June, the Egyptian had suggested he was keen to extend at various points during the season, and it emerged on Wednesday that progress had been made in talks and he was expected to renew. There has been interest in Salah from Saudi Arabia. Salah told Liverpool’s website : “I’m very excited. We have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football. “It’s great, I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it’s going to be 10.

I signed here because I believe we can win a lot of big trophies together. Keep supporting us and we’ll give it our best, and hopefully in the future we’re going to win more trophies.” Salah, who will turn 33 in June, joined Liverpool from Roma for £37m in the summer of 2017. In eight years at Anfield he has become the third-highest goalscorer on the club’s all-time list with 243 goals in 394 games. This season he has scored 27 goals in 31 Premier League games, making him the top flight’s top scorer, and has 17 assists. Liverpool are on track to secure the title, which Salah won in 2020. He has also won trophies including a Champions League, an FA Cup and two League Cups with Liverpool. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Salah, whose previous deal was set to expire this summer, had repeatedly suggested that this could be his final season at Liverpool. However, the 32-year-old has now committed himself to Arne Slot's side, signing a two-year deal that will keep him at the club until at least 2027. Discussions have been taking place for several months, with sporting director Richard Hughes overseeing negotiations with Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas Issa. Recent reports had suggested Salah -- who is Liverpool's highest-paid player -- had agreed to reduce his salary in order to remain at Anfield; however, a source told ESPN that a pay cut was never on the agenda for either party. \"Of course I'm very excited,\" he said . \"We have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football. \"It's great, I had my best years here.

This season, Salah has scored 32 goals in 45 appearances in all competitions -- including 27 Premier League goals. Salah has been the driving force behind Liverpool's pursuit of the club's 20th league title this term. His brace in the win over Southampton in March took him to third on the club's all-time scorers list. He becomes the first of Liverpool's three out-of-contract players to sign a new deal, with the futures of Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold still uncertain. Liverpool captain Van Dijk is also expected to commit to a new deal at Anfield, with the defender revealing last week that \"progress\" had been made in negations."
