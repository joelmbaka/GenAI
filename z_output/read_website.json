 The government is set to release an additional 1,088 units of
the affordable housing project to residents of Mukuru slums before the end of
the month. This is according to Athman Said, the Housing Secretary, who
has also defended the government against claims of single-sourcing for building
materials in the affordable housing projects, noting that procurement decisions
were left to individual contractors to determine based on their needs. He also dismissed claims of re-channeling the affordable
housing funds to ventures that benefit a few senior government officials. Athman argued that cases of the funds being channeled towards
other development, such as markets, are part of the social infrastructure that
is necessary for the affordable housing strategy to create holistic ecosystems. “The housing levy is ring-fenced by law. You cannot spend it
for anything else apart from housing. Now, housing is defined in law to include
not just the four walls, but also social infrastructure and physical
infrastructure,” said Athman. “What that means is if you're going to put 1,000 units, which
is about 5,000 people, they must have access to schools, medical facilities,
and people are trading.” Further, the Housing Secretary announced plans to hand over
over 1,000 affordable housing units to individuals by the end of the month. This even as he distanced the administration from claims of
cronyism in the awarding of supplies to tenders in the affordable housing
project, noting that procurement was done by the contractors without being
influenced. “The one you have mentioned, Devki, is just one of the
suppliers. Remember, the people who are making decisions on where to get the
materials from are the individual contractors,” he said. “The government does not provide materials currently… They get
cement from wherever they are going to get it, and they get steel from wherever
they are going to get it, so we do not have a single source.” The government has been urged to incentivize the private
sector to unlock new capital to bridge the housing deficit, with stakeholders
calling on the private sector to adopt the latest technology in building to
minimize their costs. Nasra Nanda, CEO of the Kenya Green Building Society, said: “We
don’t have clear incentives when it comes to affordable housing, and we need to
be clear on that. And then separately, now with sustainability, a key barrier
is if I do it the green way, what am I getting in return?”
Tom Oyier, Head of Construction at Crown Paint, on his part
noted: “The government agencies, the State Department for Housing, and
manufacturers, and the developers, we all have to come together and agree that
to deliver affordable housing, we all have to bring in our A-game.” Tags:

It is also the President’s first extensive visit to his former deputy Rigathi Gachagua’s backyard since he was impeached last year, just two years in office. Gachagua’s impeachment last October turned him from a superfluous cheerleader of the President in the Mt Kenya region and countrywide into a vociferous critic.

JAMILA'S MEMO: Forced savings or forced suffering?
Citizen Sounds Live TV Live Radio JAMILA'S MEMO: Forced savings or forced suffering? By
Jamila Mohamed
Published on: April 10, 2025 11:53 (EAT)
 The government, through Labour Cabinet Secretary Alfred Mutua, has announced plans to introduce a law aimed at encouraging Kenyans to save money — a move meant to address what he calls the country’s "perennially low savings rate." But when news of the minister’s statement hit social media, the reactions were swift — and ranged from disbelief to outright ridicule. Many Kenyans found the idea not only absurd but painfully out of touch with the economic realities facing millions of citizens. And rightly so. For years now, Kenyans have been struggling under the weight of multiple deductions, rising taxes, and an ever-growing cost of living. The suggestion that people can be forced to save — by law — feels not only impractical but insensitive. As one Kenyan put it: “Ulazimishwe kulipa tax, housing levy, pension mbili, SHIF na SHA halafu wakulazimishe kusave — total ikuje 20k na unaearn 15k. Kenya inaenda wapi?” This latest announcement has exposed what many believe to be a consistent pattern by government: a lack of imagination. Every challenge is met with legislation. Every solution is a law. But as many have pointed out, we already have a legal framework for savings — NSSF. So what will this new law do that NSSF doesn't? What happens if you "break" this new savings law? Jail time for not having money? As one Kenyan sarcastically laid out the government’s typical playbook: “1. Introduce saving deductions. 2. Have it declared unconstitutional by the High Court for lack of public participation. 3. Appeal. 4. Obtain stay of execution and 14 days to ‘rectify.’ 5. Rectify, deduct, steal and leave! WOW!” Another asked a question many are now echoing: “Have countries with high personal savings rates passed laws to enforce it? Or have they created environments that support and encourage saving?” This is the crux of the matter. You cannot legislate a culture of saving into existence. You can only nurture it by empowering citizens. That means reducing taxes on essential goods. It means ensuring affordable healthcare and education. It means eliminating corruption so that public funds actually serve the people. Look at what happened with SHA and the Affordable Housing Levy. Both entered the scene as “savings schemes,” and are now taxes by law. Many fear this proposed law will follow the same path. One X user wrote “Each day they brainstorm new ideas on how to burden Kenyans.”  This constant targeting of payslips is exhausting the working class. Already, people are contributing to NSSF. Some have deductions from sacco loans, bank repayments, health insurance, school fees — and now more mandatory "savings"? Let’s not forget: the issue isn’t that Kenyans don’t want to save. They do. They save through chamas, saccos, banks, M-PESA, even table banking. The issue is that their trust is constantly betrayed. As one person pointed out: “Most of our labor laws aren’t even operational. Most people don’t even know what gratuity is in Kenya or how it’s supposed to work .” So before introducing another policy wrapped in legalese, the government must first answer this: Where is the money from NSSF, Hustler Fund, SHA, and Housing Levy going? Who’s accounting for it? Kenyans are not resisting saving. They are resisting theft disguised as saving. They are resisting being punished for systemic failures. They are resisting a government that refuses to do the hard work of building an economy that actually works — choosing instead to legislate its way out of every crisis. If the government truly wants to improve the savings culture in Kenya, the solution is simple: Fix the economy. Lower the cost of living. Ensure job security. Pay people fairly. Enforce existing labor protections. And above all, stop stealing public funds. Want Kenyans to save? Then show them that their money is safe. Show them that their sacrifice will result in benefit — not loss. And until then, stop trying to squeeze water from a stone. And that is my memo tonight. Tags:
