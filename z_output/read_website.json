"report": "US envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg on April 11, 2025, to discuss the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The meeting, which lasted over four hours, focused on 'various aspects of the Ukrainian settlement,' according to the Kremlin. This was Witkoff's third meeting with Putin this year, and it comes amid stalled peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.

The talks are part of efforts by US President Donald Trump to secure a ceasefire deal. Trump has expressed frustration with both sides, stating that 'Russia has to get moving' and that 'too many people are dying' in the conflict. He has also threatened to impose 'secondary tariffs' on Russian oil exports if a deal is not reached.

Witkoff's meeting with Putin was described as 'productive' by Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's investment envoy. The two leaders discussed the possibility of a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Trump, although no breakthroughs are expected.

The US and Russia have also been engaged in other diplomatic efforts, including a prisoner swap that saw the release of Russian-American Ksenia Karelina, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity. The swap was seen as a positive step in building trust between the two nations.

Despite these efforts, Russia's demands remain unchanged, including opposition to NATO expansion, a reduced US presence in Europe, and security guarantees. Analysts believe that Putin is not interested in a ceasefire as Russia continues to make gains on the Ukrainian front.

The diplomatic efforts continue, with Witkoff set to travel to Oman to negotiate with Iran over nuclear talks.
