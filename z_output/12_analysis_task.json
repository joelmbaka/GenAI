{"summary":"Kiambu Governor Kimani Wamatangi was arrested on April 15, 2025, by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) over allegations of embezzlement and corruption involving Sh1.7 billion. The allegations include county officials engaging in trading with the county and receiving payments totaling Sh1.5 billion. Wamatangi has claimed that the allegations are part of a witch hunt. There is no clear evidence of a fallout between Wamatangi and President William Ruto, who is also the UDA party leader. Wamatangi had defected to UDA from Jubilee Party in 2022 and won the governor race under the UDA ticket.","web_scrape_results":{"websites":[{"url":"https://ntvkenya.co.ke/news/eacc-detectives-raid-governor-wamatangis-home-over-graft-claims/","content":"\nNTV Kenya:\n EACC raids Governor Wamatangi’s home over graft claims\nTuesday - April 15, 2025\nPersonalities\nSubscribe\nNews\nNTV Live\nPodcasts New\nBusiness\n News\nEntertainment\nSports\nPolitics\nQuick Link\nNation FM\nNTV Swahili\nHealth Diary\nNews Features\nThe Trend\nKigoda Chako\nTV Shows\n12 Minutes\n52 Fallacies\nAM Live\nArtists\nBNX\nBusiness Redefined\nEvents\nLive\n Events\nPast\n Events\nUpcoming Events\nAdvertiser\nSocial\nTikTok\nTwitter\nInstagram\nFacebook\nYoutube\nLegal\nTerms & Conditions\nNMG Privacy Policy\nBlog\n Rules\nEmpower Africa\nFAQs\nContact Us.\nHome\nFeatures\nNTV Live\nPolitics\nNews\nNTV Swahili\nEvents\nPodcast\nSports\nNation FM\nOlympics '24\nLIVE TV\nSEARCH\nHit enter to search or Esc to close\nMENU\nNTV\nApril 15, 2025\nNews\nEACC raids Governor Wamatangi’s home over graft claims\nThe Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) says it has recovered Sh13.7 million from Kiambu Governor Kimani Wamatangi’s home after a Tuesday morning raid.\nThe cash was in both Kenyan currency and dollars—Sh12 million in Kenya shilling notes and $13,000 in cash.\nThe discovery comes amid chaos that erupted at EACC headquarters in Nairobi as dozens of his supporters protested to demand the governor’s release.\nGovernor Wamatangi was arrested Tuesday morning and taken to the EACC headquarters alongside eight senior Kiambu County officials.\nThey include Peter Njoroge (County Secretary), Nancy Njeri (County Executive Committee Member for Finance), Salome Muthoni (CEC for Lands), William Kinyanhui (Chief Officer, Finance), Phyllis Wanjiru (Director, Supply Chain), Henry Mburu (Director, Revenue), Paul Kibe (Clerical Officer) and businessman Bernard Kabaiku (Director, M/s Filtronic International Limited).\nEACC boss Abdi Mohamud said the sting operation and arrests are part of an ongoing investigation into alleged financial and procurement malpractices in Kiambu County.\nKey among the allegations is that county officials engaged in trading with the county and received payments totalling Sh1.5 billion.\nBusiness Redefined\nEconomic Fiscal Outlook 2025 | Business Redefined\nWatch Video\nBusiness Redefined\nUnlocking Shariah Compliant Finance | Business Redefined\nWatch Video\nBusiness Redefined\nSustainable Finance | Business Redefined\nWatch Video\nYou May Also Like\nSee All\nchevron_right\nWatch Now\nNews\nHarvard rejects Trump demands, gets hit by $2.3 billion funding freeze\n3 hours ago\nshare\nWatch Now\nNews\nTanzania’s Samia Suluhu to inaugurate East Africa’s longest bridge\n5 hours ago\nshare\nWatch Now\nNews\nUK’s Tullow Oil to sell Kenya assets for at least Sh15.6bn\n6 hours ago\nshare\nWatch Now\nEntertainment\nSean ‘Diddy’ Combs pleads not guilty to expanded sex...\n7 hours ago\nshare\nShows\nSee All\nchevron_right\n12 Minutes\nView\n Collection\nnorth_east\n52 Fallacies\nView\n Collection\nnorth_east\nAM Live\nAM Live is NTV's morning current affairs show that sets the agenda for the day with insightful panels every weekday.\nView\n Collection\nnorth_east\nBNX\nView\n Collection\nnorth_east\nBusiness Redefined\nBusiness Redefined is Kenya’s premier thought leadership platform for unpacking matters regarding economic and finance policy as well demystifying complex developments in the region’s capital markets.\nView\n Collection\nnorth_east\nCeleb News\nView\n Collection\nnorth_east\nclimate Voices\nView\n Collection\nnorth_east\nComedies\nA collection of our premium content.
