However, the project has been marred by controversies, including claims of single-sourcing of building materials and concerns about the handling of funds. The private sector has been urged to play a bigger role in bridging the housing deficit.","content":"The Kenyan government has announced plans to hand over over 1,000 affordable housing units to individuals by the end of the month. This move is part of the government's efforts to address the country's housing deficit. According to Athman Said, the Housing Secretary, the government is set to release an additional 1,088 units to residents of Mukuru slums.\n\nHowever, the affordable housing project has not been without controversy. There have been claims of single-sourcing of building materials from companies like Devki Group. Athman Said has denied these claims, stating that procurement decisions were left to individual contractors. \"The people who are making decisions on where to get the materials from are the individual contractors,\" he said.\n\nThe government has also faced criticism over the handling of funds related to the affordable housing levy. Athman Said argued that the levy is ring-fenced by law and can only be used for housing and related social infrastructure. \"Housing is defined in law to include not just the four walls, but also social infrastructure and physical infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nStakeholders have urged the government to incentivize the private sector to unlock new capital to bridge the housing deficit. Nasra Nanda, CEO of the Kenya Green Building Society, called for clear incentives for affordable housing and sustainability. Tom Oyier, Head of Construction at Crown Paint, emphasized the need for collaboration between government agencies, manufacturers, and developers to deliver affordable housing.\n\nOn social media, there are mixed sentiments about the affordable housing project. Some residents have expressed dissatisfaction with the project, citing concerns about eviction. A tweet by NTV Kenya reported that Dagoretti residents face eviction over affordable housing construction.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Kenyan government's affordable housing project is making progress, it is facing several challenges and controversies. The government needs to address these concerns and work with the private sector to bridge the housing deficit.","keywords":["Affordable Housing","Kenya","Housing Levy","Private Sector","Devki Group"],"entities":["Athman Said","Nasra Nanda","Tom Oyier","Devki Group","Kenya Green Building Society","Crown Paint","Mukuru slums","Dagoretti"]}
