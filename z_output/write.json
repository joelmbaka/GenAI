The Egyptian international had been linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League earlier in the season.","content":"Liverpool FC can announce that Mohamed Salah has signed a new contract that will keep him with the club beyond the 2024-25 season. The forward, who is enjoying another stellar campaign for the Reds, has committed his future by putting pen to paper on the deal. So far this term, Salah has scored 32 goals in just 45 appearances in all competitions – 27 of which have come in the Premier League, making him the division’s leading marksman. These strikes have been supplemented by 22 assists for his teammates. Salah told Liverpoolfc.com in exclusive reaction: \"Of course I'm very excited. We have a great team now. Before also we had a great team. But I signed because I think we have a chance to win other trophies and enjoy my football. It's great, I had my best years here. I played eight years, hopefully it's going to be 10. Enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I had the best years in my career. I would like to say to [the fans], I am very, very happy to be here. I signed here because I believe we can win a lot of big trophies together. Keep supporting us and we'll give it our best, and hopefully in the future we're going to win more trophies.\" Salah has cemented himself as a Liverpool legend since his transfer from AS Roma in the summer of 2017. He has lifted seven major honours, picking up medals in the Premier League and Champions League, as well as the FIFA Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup, FA Cup, and two League Cups. The 32-year-old Egyptian international previously had spells with Chelsea in the Premier League and Roma in Italy's Serie A. Speculation had been mounting all season that the forward may be set to end his stay at Anfield, with Salah himself stating in December that a deal was \"far away\". A move to the Saudi Pro League had been heavily mooted as the next destination for the forward, with reports that champions Al Ittihad tabled a world-record £215 million offer as early as September 2023. Liverpool's sporting director Richard Hughes oversaw negotiations with Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas Issa. Recent reports had suggested Salah had agreed to reduce his salary to remain at Anfield; however, a source told ESPN that a pay cut was never on the agenda for either party. Salah's contract extension comes as Liverpool are on track to secure the Premier League title, a superb achievement given this is Arne Slot's first season in English football. The club's captain, Virgil van Dijk, is also expected to sign a new contract beyond this season, while Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to join Real Madrid on a free transfer in the summer.","keywords":["Mohamed Salah","Liverpool FC","Contract Extension","Premier League","Egyptian International"],"entities":["Mohamed Salah","Liverpool FC","Anfield","AS Roma","Chelsea","Saudi Pro League","Al Ittihad","Fenway Sports Group","Arne Slot","Richard Hughes","Ramy Abbas Issa","Virgil van Dijk","Trent Alexander-Arnold","Real Madrid","Premier League","Champions League","FIFA Club World Cup","UEFA Super Cup","FA Cup","League Cup"]}
