The world's youngest country, South Sudan, is on the cusp of another civil war after a peace deal ended a conflict that killed tens of thousands. The country is governed by a coalition government led by President Salva Kiir and five vice presidents, including Riek Machar, the leader of the SPLM/A-IO party. Machar's arrest has sparked fears of a return to war, with the UN warning that the situation is "one step closer to the edge of a collapse into civil war." The country is polarized between the majority Dinka tribe and Machar's Nuer ethnic group, and clashes have broken out in the town of Nasir. The international community is urging calm and de-escalation, but the situation remains volatile.
