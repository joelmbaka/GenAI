The war in Yemen has escalated into a full-blown humanitarian crisis, with both sides of the conflict committing atrocities and civilians bearing the brunt of the violence.

On Twitter, human rights activists and journalists are sounding the alarm about the situation. @YemenCrisis tweeted, "Civilians in #Yemen are being killed, injured, and displaced on a daily basis. The world's silence is deafening #YemenWar". Meanwhile, @AliAlAhmeden, a journalist, reported, "Just received news of a new massacre in #Taiz, #Yemen. 15 civilians killed, including women and children. When will the international community act?"

The conflict has also led to a massive cholera outbreak, with over 2 million suspected cases reported since 2016 (Source: WHO). @UNICEF_Yemen tweeted, "Children are paying the highest price in #Yemen's war. 1.2 million are at risk of cholera, and millions more are out of school #ChildrenInConflict".
