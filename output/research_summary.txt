Mungiki is a banned sect in Kenya that was involved in various criminal activities. Recently, there have been concerns about its resurgence, particularly in the Mt Kenya region. The sect's leaders, including Maina Njenga, have been involved in politics, and some have even been accused of mobilizing support for certain politicians. However, their activities have been met with resistance from locals, leading to violent confrontations. The government has been urged to take action against the sect's revival, and there are ongoing efforts to address the issue.

Please note that this summary is based on general knowledge and may not be a comprehensive overview of the topic.
